Hello there! 

This is the go home project for Portland Web Works. 

Currently I am working on the Navigation bar of this project, especially on making the hamburger menu and search bar work. After that, the plan is to add the styles as per the documentation. For now, I have used my own styles into this project so as to be able to present something.

The problems I faced involved getting the images to work despite targetting the exact directories where they were. I have even tried changing their directories and getting them to work but to no avail. Instead, I used images from unsplash however later on I decided against them and instead put alt text to the images that are not loading in the browser while testing. 

I am still trying my best to make this work completely because I feel this project is very interesting and is making me learn something new everyday.
